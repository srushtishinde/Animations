# Animations
Animations is an open source collection of coded animations, containing but not limited to loaders, menus, scroll transitions, and much more.
Animation has been around since before the web began, enhancing visual content and, in many cases, animation is used to highlight the interface. Today, animation is not just part of a website's content, it’s a fundamental feature, essential to increasing interaction with the site.
Our project aims to provide a solution to the issue raised by a GitHub user, which specified the need for creating a custom landing page for all the contributed or to be contributed animations which fall under the ‘enhancement, good-first-issue and help-wanted’ tags on GitHub.
Website design has experienced many changes and disruptive innovations. Web designers
have started using web animations to breathe life and motion into static website layouts. Web
design animations have become a new trend dominating our screens in recent years.They
make the user experience more intuitive and exciting. Website design animation turns an
ordinary user experience into an unforgettable journey that amazes with its bold colors,
movements, adventures, and exciting interactions.
Along with the landing page, the codes for various types of animations like click, form,
hover, landing, load, menu and scroll animations using CSS and its frameworks will be
available. The dashboard will allow the users who wish to contribute, to upload their codes
for various types of animations. All these animations will be a contribution to the open source
community and will be free for anybody’s use.
